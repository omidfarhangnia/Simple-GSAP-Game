# Simple__Game__With__GSAP
this is a mini project for working with some important methods and some basic structure of gsap

## game rules
at the beginning you can see a ball with the white color some blocks with the red colors and a green box on the right top of your page you can use your right left up down arrows
to move your ball if you touch the red block you will loose immediately you should be careful after passing the red block you should touch green box in this case
you will win if you lose or if you win we have an animation for you and i used quickSetters for moving the circle , stagger for gameResultAnimation function and i used exportRoot
for the time that you loosed or won
